# Random Programming 101

This repository contains random pieces of code that I have written inspired from various sources of information. An inspiration for developing such a repository is from [Ayush Bharadwaj](https://github.com/Ayush1651999)'s repository on [Random-Programming](https://github.com/Ayush1651999/Random-Programming)

***
## [Radix Sort](../master/radixSort.py)

This is a small piece of Python code to sort numbers using radix sort.  
The best part about radix sort is that the worst case has a linear order, dependent on the product of the number of object and the number of digits of the largest object

***
## [Random String Generator](../master/randomStringGen.py)

This piece of code can be used to generate `numStrings` number of random strings with random lengths not exceeding `maxLen`. This is inspired from a finger exercise in MITx 6.00.2.

***
## [Sum of Random Variables](../master/randomSumPDF.py)

This piece of code adds `randomSumNum` number of uniform distributions (from `random.random()`). The discreteness of the random variable can be determined by varying `listSize`.
