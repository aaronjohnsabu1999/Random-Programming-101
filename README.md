# Random Programming 101

This repository contains random pieces of code that I have written inspired from various sources of information. An inspiration for developing such a repository is from [Ayush Bharadwaj](https://github.com/Ayush1651999)'s repository on [Random-Programming](https://github.com/Ayush1651999/Random-Programming)

## [Radix Sort](../master/radixSort.py)

This is a small piece of Python code to sort numbers using radix sort.  
The best part about radix sort is that the worst case has a linear order, dependent on the product of the number of object and the number of digits of the largest object
